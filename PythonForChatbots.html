    <h1>Python for Chatbots</h1>
    <p>In <a href="PythonAI.html">Python for AI</a>, one use of AI mentioned was for chatbots. Such chatbots are possible using Python.</p>
    <h1>What is a chatbot?</h1>
    <p>A chatbot is a virtual assistant that interacts with the user through text. In Python, these chatbots can use basic print() and input() commands, or much more detailed processes. In this page, I will go over the process of making a basic chatbot.</p>
    <h1>Different approaches to making a chatbot</h1>
    <p>There are multiple ways that one could make a chatbot. For starters, one could use simple print and input() functions and make a chatbot like the one shown below:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/e224cc1a2530ceab7bf32b8378f17584.js"></script>
    <p>In this chatbot, the main function of the chatbot is held within a function that repeats itself as long as the user chooses to replay it. All this chatbot does is ask for two values and adds them. While this is useful in this case, it could be a lot cooler, enter Transformers, a library that makes it easy and efficient to make chatbots.</p>
    <p>Transformers utilizes AI as well as Natural Language Processing to make chatbots. In order to use Transformers you must have TensorFlow, or any of the other compatible frameworks, installed, as well as a dataset. Note that if no dataset is provided, then Transformers will automatically download one.</p>
    <h1>Setup</h1>
    <p>Setting up a bot in Transformers is easy, all you need is to pick a pipeline, which is what you want your bot to focus on, and provide the bot with input, as shown below.</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/44348725e6aa5f7a6f643917d539a51a.js"></script>
    <p>That's it! in those few lines of code a working AI chatbot has been created. Note that this chatbot isn't necessarily fully functional and may have bugs.</p>
