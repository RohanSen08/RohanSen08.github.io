        <h1>Python For AI</h1>
        <h1>Frameworks</h1>
        <p>Note: for the sake of simplicity, this page will only outline the basics of AI in Python.</p>
        <p>There are many deep learning frameworks in Python, notably PyTorch and TensorFlow, that can be used for deep learning.</p>
        <p>Let's define some basics, AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, and in many AI frameworks, the code aims to replicate the neuron. There are multiple types of AI, but for this tutorial I'm going to focus on Deep Learning, which uses multiple layers of Artificial neurons to analyze data.</p>
        <p>These artificial neurons follow the Perceptron algorithm. Perceptron takes inputs and a bias node, uses weights to calculate the importance of each input, takes the sum, uses an activation function in each hidden layer, then produces an output, as shown below.</p>

        <h1>Training</h1>
        <p>When using deep learning, the deep learning model must be trained with data in order to function properly and accurately. Let's say you want to make a program that detects faces, you would need a dataset with a large quantity of photos of faces to train the model. Thankfully, you don't have to manually make your own dataset for everything, datasets are available as imports.</p>
        <p>Using this training, deep learning networks can analyze data and send back results, note that these results aren't always correct.</p>
        <h1>Backpropagation</h1>
        <p>While deep learning networks aren't perfect, they can be made more accurate through backpropagation, which determines uses results to alter the value of weights, leading to more accurate results. Some common backpropagation methods are Adam, Stochastic gradient decent, gradient decent, and Mini-batch gradient.</p>
        <h1>Uses of AI</h1>
        <p>Now that the concepts of AI are out of the way, let's discuss some uses of AI. AI is frequently used for image processing and classification, chatbots ad virtual assistants, robotics, facial recognition, and much more! For example, Siri, Tesla Autopilot, Adobe Photoshop's neural filters, and targeted Google AdSense advertisements, all utilize Artificial Intelligence.</p>
