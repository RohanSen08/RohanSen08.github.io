        <h1>Basics of Python</h1>
        <p>Unlike many programming languages, Python syntax is based on indentation and the position of a snippet of code within another snippet of code is based on whether it is indented. When using Python you should always be attentive of spacing as it will determine if your code will work.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/aa6b2d704642b6a1ab88b2ccea41c6da.js"></script>
        <p>Using that knowledge, lets begin!</p>
        <hr/>
        <h1>Variables</h1>
        <p>Python variables are super simple to make, and unlike most programming languages don't require you to declare the variable with a command. All you have to do is give the name of a variable and set its value and the variable is automatically made, with the type determined automatically, as shown in the snippet below.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/91b8ef0501b1018771b3521e6a5d99a1.js"></script>
        <p>Now let's go over the types of variables you can make. There are many types of variables you might need later on, and it's even possible to create your own type of variable, but the most common ones you'll see are Strings, Ints, Floats, and Bools.</p>
        <p>Let's start with strings, strings hold text values and the values have to be enclosed in quotations.</p>
        <p>NOTE: While strings CAN be used for other values, the value won't be read as its actual type and will just be treated like text.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/7e007a1ed544fcc68bb50ae1b0b3522e.js"></script>
        <p>Next up are Ints, or Integers. Just like in Math, Python Integers are non-decimal numbers. For Ints, quotations are not necessary.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/b9737ad30c8ad2bf0555867dd1cb9384.js"></script>
        <p>Now to add decimals, you'll need a different type of variable, enter the Float, which is like the Int except with support for decimal values. Floats are defined the same way as Ints except if there's a decimal then Python will infer the type as a Float rather than an Int.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/144072a003d991f5914441be17fcc9cb.js"></script>
        <p>Lastly, we have the Bool, which is named for the mathematician George Boole. A Bool has only two values, True and False. Note that these values are not in quotations.</p>

        <h1>Converting Variables</h1>
        <p>Just as you could set a variable to a value of a certain type, you can convert the type through functions. To change the type, set the value of a variable, it can be the same variable as the original variable, to the result of a specific function, which varies for each type, with the input within parenthesis set to the variable. To convert a value to a float, you would use the function float(); to convert to an integer, use the function int(); to convert to a string, use the function str(); however, when converting something to bool using thr bool() function, the value will be True if there is any value, and False if there is no input. Do note that no matter what you are converting, the value must be valid in the type you are converting it to. In other words, you can't make the string "Hello World!" an integer since there is no valid number "Hello World", but you can make "5" an integer since the value of the string, 5, is valid as an integer.</p>

        <h1>Interpolating</h1>
        <p>Even though the name sounds quite long, interpolating is simple. It when you put a variable inside another value or string, and is commonly used to insert variables inside print functions. Note that the interpolating method shown is only valid in Python 3.6 and later versions. String interpolation is done by prefixing an f before the string and putting the variable itself within brackets inside of the string.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/d2f730719e73e3e220ced1cd927f70f6.js"></script>
        <h1>Print and Input</h1>
        <p>Now lets go over the print and input functions, these are simple ways for the user to interact with the Python script through the Terminal. print() is used to print a line to the terminal, the value it prints is stored within the parenthesis and can be a raw value like a String or Int, or a variable that was previously made. input() on the other hand, would be defined as the value of a variable and would be printed to Terminal as a user input, with the answer being taken as the value of the variable. The question the user is asked would be contained within the parentheses, following the same rules as the print() function.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/de2ff153304d3436279aa04c7cd273b3.js"></script>
        <hr/>
        <h1>If/Else logic</h1>
        <p>Let's start with the conditionals used. To check if a variable is equal to a value use two equal signs, or ==. To see if something isn't true, use =!, to see greater than, use =>, and to see less than, use =< </p>
        <p>Now, let's add some logic to this code. An if/else statement can be used to do this. The way an if/else statement works is it checks if a value is true, if it is then the code performs a function, if not, then it either checks if another value is true, or performs a function set for if the value is different. There are three functions in an if/else statement, if, elif, and else. If is always the first function in an if/else and checks if a specific value is true, elif has the same function as if except is used if you are checking a condition other than the if condition, and else is always the last part of an if/else and contains the code that should be executed if none of the other values checked are true.</p>
        <p>The syntax of if/else statements is simple, the keyword goes first, then the value checked, then a colon. The code for that part of the if/else statement is then on the following lines and indented, with the next part of the if/else not being indented.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/f914c95098e99ee9ef01fb195e683c54.js"></script>
        <h1>Functions</h1>
        <p>We have already interacted with some functions, now let's make our own. The syntax of a function is def nameoffunction(any information that should be passed through): indented code on the next lines. Note that to return any variables from the function you must use, "return variable(s) to be returned." Functions in Python by writing the name of the function, its parenthesis, and any and all data to be imported. If you want to have an indefinite amount of data, you can use *args for non keywords and **kwargs for keywords.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/876b04f9b36a2495c2e3b22dc6ea5f5d.js"></script>
        <h1>For loops</h1>
        <p>Let's say you want to repeat a code multiple times, rather than copying and pasting a code 50 times, you can just use a loop! The syntax of a loop is similar to that of an if/else, the code indented after the declaration of the for loop will be repeated. You can declare a for loop using, for i in range(times you want repeated): (code repeated is indented on the next lines). Additionally, you can get what point in the loop you are on by referring to the variable declared after for, in this case i.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/6b9b3284d2ab410f2c35bd6df10d39fc.js"></script>
        <h1>While loops</h1>
        <p>Now let's create some loops with a bit more logic, enter the while loop. While loops repeat like for loops, however they will only repeat if something is true. This can be especially useful if you need the user to enter some data properly. The while loop is declared as followed: while variable == 1: (code indented on next line). Note that you can make an infinite loop by using while True: rather than setting a variable.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/d04f1d645629f290ca365a415889f16c.js"></script>
        <h1>Importing</h1>
        <p>When you use Python in actual applications, the bare basics aren't enough, you need actual frameworks, and rather than manually making a framework just so you can do something basic, you can import a library someone else made to help with it. Libraries in Python are sort of like parts in a car, like the engine, you need them to do certain things, but you don't build them yourself, you use a pre manufactured engine, not to say that you don't do the work of plugging in the engine and getting a car to work, you'll still need do something. You can import something to Python using the import. The syntax of import is import (package name). Note that to import a library it must actually be installed. Additionally, you can use import to organize your code by putting your functions in different files and then importing them.</p>
