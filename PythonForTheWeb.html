        <h1>Python For The Web</h1>
        <p>When making websites, HTML can only go so far. In order to make a website have certain functionalities, a backend is needed. Backends can be written in PHP, C#(ASP.NET), Python, and much more! In our case, we'll be focusing on Python for the backend. In Python, there are multiple frameworks for this, including Flask, Django, Web2Py, Pyramid, and many more. For this tutroial, we'll use Flask.</p>
        <h1>Flask</h1>
        <p>Flask is a lightweight framework for making backends. In Flask each endpoint for the site is a function, which returns a value. In order to declare this, first you have to declare a Flask app and import flask.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/b5520b904c7c9c2eb2e3e0a09774956f.js"></script>
        <p>Then, you can declare routes by using @app.route("/(whatever you want the route to be named)") and making a function for it.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/10541ad30a3fa69187ad6f729ec07ab6.js"></script>
        <h1>Passing data into a Flask route</h1>
        <p>Now that we've established how to make a route, let's establish how to pass data to a route. This data is passed to the route through the website branch you go to. You can implement this in flask by setting the route to a variable within <> and then referring to it in a function, as shown in the example. </p>

        <h1>Render Templates</h1>
        <p>Now let's get into the functional side of flask, with render templates. Render templates are html files that are hosted on a flask app's endpoint(s). Render templates use normal html syntax as well as html files but include the ability to add backend function through a template language known as Jinja2. With Jinja2, it is possible to pass through variables into html, loop a certain snippet of code, use if/else logic in your code, and much more!</p>
        <p>Let's focus on passing through variables, in order to do this, there is code necessary in both the Python web app and the HTML document.</p>
        <p> In the HTML document, you implement the variable by including {{whatever the variable is named}}. Note that when this code is interpreted by Jinja2, the variable name and brackets will be replaced by the value of the variable.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/potatobob/25d510ddea7ba5f90a1a3a14ea1e8815.js"></script>
        <p>Additionally, on the Python side code is needed. In order to pass through data from the web app, first we need to import the ability to make render templates. To do so, add render_template to the list of imports from flask. Then, set the value of a variable within the function of a web app and set the return value to render_template("name of html file", name of variable within render template=name of variable within python). Then, when a user accesses your site, the html they will receive will contain the value of the variable. </p>
